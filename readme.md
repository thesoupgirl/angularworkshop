This tutorial is meant for people that have no experience with web development whatsoever. If you have some experience, you might want to skip around quite a bit. The tutorial teaches AngularJS, CSS, and HTML. The output will be a portfolio website to use when job hunting. Good luck and I hope you all enjoy!
